    <p>When I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on, I still do 
      feel that it should go on but when I first began writing I was completely
      possessed by the necessity that writing should go on and on and if writing 
      should go on what had colons and commas to do with it, what had periods to
      do with it what had small letters and capitals to do with it to do with writing 
      going on which was at that time the most profound need I had in connection with 
      writing. What had colons and semi-colons to do with it what had commas to do with 
      it what had periods to do with it.What had periods to do with it. Inevitably no matter 
      how completely I had to have writing go on, physically one had to again and again stop 
      sometime and if one had to again and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again 
      stop some time then periods had to exist. Beside I had always like the look of periods and I 
      liked what they did. Stopping sometime did not really keep one from going on, it was nothing 
      that interfered, it was only something that happened, and as it happened as a perfectly natural 
      happening, I did not believe in periods and I used them. I really never stopped using them.
      Beside that periods might later come to have a life of their own to commence breaking up things in 
      arbitrary ways, that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way, 
      later I will read you a little of it. By the time I had written this poem about three years ago 
      periods had come to have for me completely a life of their own.

    <p>They could begin to act as they thought best and one might interrupt one’s writing with them that is not really interrupt one’s 
      writing with them but one could come to stop arbitrarily stop at times in one’s writing and so 
      they could be used and you could use them Periods could come to exist in this way and they could 
      come in this way to have a life of their own. They did not serve you in any servile way as commas
      and colons and semi-colons do. Yes you do feel what I mean.Periods have a life of their own a necessity 
      of their own a feeling of their own a time of their own. And that feeling that life that necessity that 
      time can express itself in an infinite variety that is the reason that I have always remained true to 
      periods so much so that as I say recently I have felt that one could need them more than one had ever needed them.
      You can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a comma, a colon or a semi-colon.
      There are two different way of thinking about colons and semicolons you can think of them as commas 
      and as such they are purely servile or you can think of them as periods and then using them can make you feel 
      adventurous I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I myself never have, I began unfortunately 
      to feel them as a comma and commas are servile they have no life of their own they are dependent upon use and 
      convenience and they are put there just for practical purposes.
