        Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye nor 
        the ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary 
        name of something. A question is a question, anybody can know that 
        a question is a question and so why add to it the question mark when it is already there 
        when the question is already there in the writing. Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark, 
        I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it.

      <h1> Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks, they are unnecessary, 
        they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or 
        the printing and anyway what is the use, if you do not know that a 
        question is a question what is the use of its being a question. The same 
        thing is true of a quotation. When I first began writing I found it simply 
        impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and exclamation points and now 
        anybody sees it that way. Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at any 
        rate anybody can and does see it that way.
